# COVID-19_Impact_on_University_Students
This project explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college and university students. By analyzing data from 675 students in the UK, we aim to understand how the pandemic has affected various aspects of their lives, including mental health, financial situation, and overall well-being. The results of the findings, including tables and charts, were obtained using SPSS software and can be found in the "Analysis of COVID" section of my repository.
